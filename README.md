This project is a web application for managing two decks of cards. It provides a user interface where cards can be interacted with using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. The interface includes two columns, each representing a deck of cards. Users can perform various actions such as shuffling, resetting, clearing, and sorting the cards in each deck. The application is implemented using HTML for the layout and C# for the backend logic. It utilizes event handlers to respond to user inputs and update the state of the card decks accordingly.

## Requirements

- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Backend server environment supporting C# (e.g., ASP.NET Core)
- .NET Core SDK (for compiling and running the C# code)
- HTML and CSS support for rendering the user interface
- Compatible with modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge

1. **Install .NET Core SDK:**
   Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download and install the SDK from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

2. **Clone the Source Code:**
   Clone the source code of the application to a local repository on your computer.

3. **Run the Application:**
   Navigate to the directory where the source code of the application is located in your terminal or command prompt. Then, follow these steps:
   
   - Compile the application by entering `dotnet build`.
   - Run the application by entering `dotnet run`.

4. **Open in a Web Browser:**
   After running the application, you'll see information in the terminal about the address at which the application is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to see the application in action.

Make sure you meet the requirements regarding the web browser and .NET Core environment. If you encounter any issues while running the application, check the console or event logs for more information about any potential errors.
